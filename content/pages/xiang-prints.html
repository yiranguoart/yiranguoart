<h3>Hide</h3>
<p>Hide is a series of Risograph prints that are part of the animation project <a href="../../moving-image/xiang">像 (Xiàng)</a>. The animation is inspired by a story from the <em>Liezi</em>, one of the Daoist classics. The story starts with a man who kills a deer and hides it under banana leaves. When he returns the deer has disappeared, and he thinks it must have been a dream. One day the man tells the story to a fisherman, who then goes out and finds the deer. The first man meanwhile dreams about the fisherman, and based on this dream sets out to find him—and the deer. Fascinated by the ambiguity of dreams and reality in the story, I made a series of collages with found images from traditional Chinese medical books and mono prints from the animation. The deer and the man hide and reappear from print to print.
