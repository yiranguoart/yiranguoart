<h3>Höuse</h3>

<p>Höuse is a special-bonded Risograph book. It began with a repeated house image, returning in different forms, sometimes folded, sometimes upside down. It is accompanied by unsettling, otherworldly scenes, and characters—sometimes cutouts, sometimes behind the windows—that can be considered the tenants of this haunted house, or visitors to viewers’ dreams.</p>

<p>Risoprinted book<br>10 x 11 inches<br>2022<br> Available for purchase at <a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/catalog/52330/">Printed Matter</a></p>

<h3>On The Way</h3>

<p>On The Way collects a series of drawings which depict strangers in transit on the streets and subway lines of New York City. Rendered in the fluid line-work and scratchy tonal values of graphite and colored pencil, the drawings capture the spontaneous humanity on display in the rushing crowds. The book carries the viewer from the summer and fall of 2019 through the devastating early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and the city’s tentative re-emergence from lockdown in the summer of 2020.</p>
